Hello Everyone!
I am happy to share my first task in my internship journey in the domain Web Development at Main Flow Services and Technologies 

I created a simple webpage using 
HTML to structure content, incorporating elements like headings, paragraphs, and images and 
CSS for styling, including colors, fonts, margins, and positioning. 

Overall this is a simple webpage for CodersDen, showcasing its services,courses, and contact information.
